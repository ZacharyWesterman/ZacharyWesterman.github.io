## Introduction

Here I will write some introduction about functions. Something has to go here to prep the reader, but I will get the basic page structure down first before I figure out what that is.


## General Math Functions

The **floor(x)** function returns the nearest integer that is less than or equal to **x**.

For example,
```
main
  print floor(12.5)
endmain
```

would output
```
12
```



The **ceil(x)** function returns the nearest integer that is greater than or equal to **x**. In other words, it returns the ceiling of **x**.

For example,
```
main
  print ceil(12.3)
endmain
```

would output
```
13
```
