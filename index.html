        <p>These are projects that I often come back to because I enjoy working on them. No particular order.</p>

                <br>
                A general-purpose library to take the pain out of C++ development.
                Contains a lot of useful quality-of-life functions and classes that I've developed over the years, while
                still being less bloated than something like Boost.
                Most importantly, it is simple to use, decently performant, and platform-independent.

                <strong><a href="https://github.com/zacharywesterman/skrunk" target="_blank">SKRUNK</a></strong> -
                <a href="skrunk/" target="_blank">Documentation</a>
                <br>
                My home-built database solution for managing personal data and interacting with other projects.
                It's light on dependencies and performant even on slow or spotty connections. A significant focus is
                also on security; in addition to requiring auth for <i>every request</i>, there is a robust system of
                permissions, user groups, & modules that allow for both over-arching and fine-grained control over who
                can access what; all of which are enforced on the backend as well as the frontend.
            </li>

                A scripting language originally designed for use in a game engine, but now usable on any machine that
                can run Lua.
                It can even create standalone executables for systems that don't have Lua installed!
